A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system of a computer. It is a program that accepts text commands from the user and executes them. The shell provides access to the operating system's services, utilities, and programs, allowing users to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as managing files, running programs, and configuring system settings.

There are several types of shells available for different operating systems, such as Bash for Linux and macOS, PowerShell for Windows, and zsh for Unix-like systems. The shell is a powerful tool that can be used to automate tasks, create scripts, and perform complex operations efficiently.

This custom made shell is designed to mimic the original shell
